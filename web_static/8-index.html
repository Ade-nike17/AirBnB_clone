                            Our place is a private, affordable stand-alone guests house centrally located just minutes to French Quarters, downtown, the fair Grounds (Jazz Fest) and City Park. The guest house is a quaint, 400 square ft. with a full bath, mini kitchen & living room. The extra high ceilings make the home feel more spacious. The sofa converts to a bed also. We have a handmade counter area that adds character to the room and a great porch/deck to relax on and have a glass of Merlot.

                            The villa is in a quiet location at the end of a ‘privada’ (cul-de-sac) in the western part of San Angel. It’s a 15-minute stroll down cobbled streets to reach the historic center with its famous church and weekend markets. San Angel is in the south of Mexico City. Most touristic areas are 30-45' drive away but you will appreciated the calm in this busy city and yet be close to most areas. San Angel can easily be visited on foot, for further distances we recommend Uber or we can organize for a driver with car. We can help you getting around in Mexico City, can hire a trusted driver with car if needed or even show you around. Tell us what you need so what we can make your stay unforgettable.
